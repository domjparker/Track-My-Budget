## Description 

This is a simple application that allows the user to track their spending habits and the amount of money they currently have for whatever they have assigned. It is backed by a Mongo database, but also has offline tracking capability because data is saved to cached storage. The app also has Progressive Web Application capability. I made it to experiment with each of these things mentioned.
